# Russian Course Materials
This repository contains the Russian course materials initially designed for RUS200 at Phillips Academy. It was adapted from the previous non-digital course materials, which were themselves adapted from _Русский Язык Для Всех_. For more information, see [parussian.org](https://parussian.org).

### Making Edits
To edit the website generated from this code, simply edit files in this repository and save them to GitHub — the changes will automatically be pushed to parussian.org by TravisCI, a free continuous integration service for open source projects (like this website).

### Structure
The files that will be most useful are the lesson files in [`_lessons`](/_lessons). These are Markdown files, and can therefore also contain HTML.

### Technologies
This website uses the following technologies:

* Jekyll (with a custom theme)
* TravisCI

As foundational components, it also uses:

* GitHub
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Ruby
